# Favicon Files

This directory should contain the following favicon files created from the MindDrink logo:

- `favicon-32.png` (32×32 pixels)
- `favicon-16.png` (16×16 pixels)
- `favicon.svg` (optional, but recommended for modern browsers)

## How to create favicons

You can create these files by resizing your existing logo (`mindrink_icon_256.png` or `mindrink_icon_512.png`) to the required sizes.

Recommended tools:
- Online: https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Image editor: GIMP, Photoshop, or any image editor that can resize PNG files
- Command line: ImageMagick or similar tools

The favicon links are already added to index.html and will work once these image files are placed in this directory.
